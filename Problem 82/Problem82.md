Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked Microsoft.

Using a read7() method that returns 7 characters from a file, implement readN(n)
which reads n characters.

For example, given a file with the content âHello worldâ, three read7() returns
âHello wâ, âorldâ and then ââ.
