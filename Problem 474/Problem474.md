Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Find the minimum number of coins required to make n cents.

You can use standard American denominations, that is, 1Â¢, 5Â¢, 10Â¢, and 25Â¢.

For example, given n = 16, return 3 since we can make it with a 10Â¢, a 5Â¢, and a
1Â¢.
