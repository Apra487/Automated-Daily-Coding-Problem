Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Yelp.

Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), and a digit string,
return all possible letters the number could represent. You can assume each
valid number in the mapping is a single digit.

For example if {â2â: [âaâ, âbâ, âcâ], 3: [âdâ, âeâ, âfâ], â¦} then â23â should
return [âadâ, âaeâ, âafâ, âbdâ, âbeâ, âbfâ, âcdâ, âceâ, âcf"].
