Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Let X be a set of n intervals on the real line. We say that a set of points P
"stabs" X if every interval in X contains at least one point in P. Compute the
smallest set of points that stabs X.

For example, given the intervals [(1, 4), (4, 5), (7, 9), (9, 12)], you should
return [4, 9].
